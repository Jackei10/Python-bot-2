Install the required library: pip install discord.py

Create a MySQL database and a table to store authentication tokens:

Replace "your_mysql_host", "your_mysql_user", "your_mysql_password", and "your_mysql_database" with your MySQL database information. Also, replace "your_discord_bot_token" with the token of your Discord bot.

Now, run the bot.py script, and your bot should respond to the !hello command if the server is authenticated.
